## üëç What is a good dataset?

Data is the most valuable asset in LLM development. When building a dataset, we target the three following characteristics:

* **Accuracy**: Samples should be factually correct and relevant to their corresponding instructions. This can involve using solvers for math and unit tests for code.
* **Diversity**: You want to cover as many use cases as possible to make sure you're never out of distribution. High diversity is essential as it leads to better generalization.
* **Complexity**: Answers should be both detailed (to maximize helpfulness) and include system 2 techniques like chain of thought (to force step-by-step reasoning).

Measuring accuracy is easy in most cases but near-impossible with open-ended, subjective questions. On the other hand, clustering datasets by topic is a good way of evaluating data mixture diversity. Finally, complexity can be assessed using other LLMs acting like judges.

## üìÖ Open SFT datasets

Once a model has been pre-trained on a next-token prediction task, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to turn it into an assistant capable of answering questions and following instructions. These datasets contain pairs of instructions and outputs to train LLMs to understand conversational structure. Unless otherwise noted, all datasets listed here are under permissive licenses (Apache 2.0, MIT, CC-BY-4.0, etc.).

### General-purpose mixtures

General-purpose datasets offer balanced mixtures of different types of data, including chat, code, and math. These datasets can be used to create general-purpose models that can handle various types of queries.

### Math

LLMs often struggle with mathematical reasoning and formal logic, which has led to the creation of specialized datasets. These datasets can include systematic thinking and step-by-step reasoning.

| Dataset                                                                             | #    | Authors       | Date      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Code

Code is another challenging domain for LLMs. Code datasets, containing diverse programming language examples, are used to fine-tune LLMs and enhance their ability to understand, generate, and analyze code.

### Instruction following

Instruction following corresponds to the ability to properly follow constraints in the user prompt, such as "write only two paragraphs", "write your answer in French", etc. Strong instruction-following capabilities is a must-have for modern LLMs.

### Multilingual

Learning new languages "from scratch" is a pre-training task, but providing multilingual instruction samples is useful to boost performance in the languages of interest.

### Agent & Function calling

Function calling allows large language models (LLMs) to execute predefined functions with parameters inferred from user prompts, rather than generating standard text responses. This enables LLMs to seamlessly integrate with external systems, perform complex operations, and provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

### Real conversations

Real-world conversations provide valuable insights into how people naturally interact with LLMs, helping us identify the most important use cases and understand typical usage patterns.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Preference alignment

Unlike instruction data, preference datasets consist of chosen and rejected answers. Preference alignment is used to align LLM's answers with human preferences to adopt the desired style and values.

## üîß Tools

Tools listed in this section can help you evaluate, generate, and explore datasets. Start by aggregating available data from various sources (open-source or not) and applying filters like data deduplication and data quality. If the initial dataset is small or insufficient, consider synthetically generating additional data to fill the gap. Iteratively explore and refine the dataset by assessing model performance, identifying gaps, and collecting or generating data to address those shortcomings.
### Data scraping
* [**Trafilatura**](https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura): Python and command-line tool to gather text and metadata on the web. Used for the creation of [RefinedWeb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116).
* [**Marker**](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker): Quickly convert PDFs to markdown text.

### Data filtering
* **Rule-based filtering**: Remove samples based on a list of unwanted words, like refusals and "As an AI assistant" ([example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cognitivecomputations/WizardLM_alpaca_evol_instruct_70k_unfiltered/blob/main/wizardlm_clean.py)).
* [**SemHash**](https://github.com/MinishLab/semhash): Fuzzy deduplication based on fast embedding generation with a distilled model.
* [**Argilla**](https://argilla.io/): Platform that allows you to manually filter and annotate datasets in a collaborative way.
* [**judges**](https://github.com/quotient-ai/judges): Small library of LLM judges with various classifiers and graders (early development).

### Data generation
* [**Curator**](https://github.com/bespokelabsai/curator/): Synthetic data generation tool that makes it easy to build pipelines around LLMs, use batching, and view data in progress.
* [**Distilabel**](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel): General-purpose framework that can generate and augment data (SFT, DPO) with techniques like UltraFeedback and DEITA.
* [**Augmentoolkit**](https://github.com/e-p-armstrong/augmentoolkit): Framework to convert raw text into datasets using open-source and closed-source models.
* [**Data Prep Kit**](https://github.com/IBM/data-prep-kit): Framework for data preparation for both code and language, with modules in Python, Ray, and Spark, and a wide range of scale from laptops to data centers.

### Data exploration
* [**Lilac**](https://github.com/lilacai/lilac): Tool for exploration, curation and quality control of datasets.
* [**Nomic Atlas**](https://github.com/nomic-ai/nomic): Interact with instructed data to find insights and store embeddings.
