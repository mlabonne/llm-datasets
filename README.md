## üëç What is a good dataset?

Data is the most valuable asset in LLM development. While datasets can't be directly evaluated like models, high-quality datasets have the following characteristics:

* **Accuracy**: Samples should be factually correct, helpful to users, and well-written. Answers should also be relevant to their corresponding instructions.
* **Diversity**: You want to cover as many use cases as possible to ensure proper instruction-following and relevant answers. This requires a wide range of topics, contexts, lengths, writing styles, etc. sampled in a representative way.
* **Complexity**: Answers should be nontrivial and a/ representative of tasks you expect the model to handle or b/ include complex tasks involving multi-step reasoning, planning, etc. 

Measuring accuracy can be easy in the case of mathematical problems using a Python interpreter, or near-impossible with open-ended, subjective questions. On the other hand, clustering datasets by topic is a good way of measuring diversity. Finally, complexity can be assessed using other LLMs acting like judges.

## üìÖ Open SFT datasets

Once a model has been pre-trained on a next-token prediction task, supervised fine-tuning is used to turn it into an assistant capable of answering questions and achieving tasks. These datasets contain pairs of instructions and outputs to train LLMs to go beyond their pre-training objective. All the datasets listed here should be under permissive licensing (Apache 2.0, MIT, cc-by-4.0, etc.).

### General-purpose

The goal of general-purpose datasets is to transform base models into versatile and capable assistants by exposing them to a wide range of high-quality data. These datasets often include a diverse mix of real-world and synthetic data, commonly generated using models like GPT-4.

### Math & Logic

LLMs often struggle with mathematical reasoning and formal logic, which has led to the creation of specialized datasets. These datasets extend beyond pure mathematics, encompassing a wide range of problems that require systematic thinking and step-by-step reasoning, ultimately enabling LLMs to tackle complex real-world challenges that involve logical deduction and quantitative analysis.

| Dataset                                                                             | #    | Authors      | Date     | Notes                                                                                                                                  |

### Conversation & Role-Play

Many datasets focus on pairs of instructions and outputs, but chat models are often used in conversational settings. Conversational and role-play datasets expose LLMs to the patterns, nuances, and context-dependent nature of real conversations, allowing them to generate more natural, and engaging dialogues.

### Multilingual

Learning new languages "from scratch" is a pre-training task, but providing multilingual instruction samples is useful to boost performance in the languages of interest.

### Agent & Function calling

Function calling allows large language models (LLMs) to execute predefined functions with parameters inferred from user prompts, rather than generating standard text responses. This enables LLMs to seamlessly integrate with external systems, perform complex operations, and provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Preference alignment

 Preference alignment datasets are collections of data used to address the alignment of an LLM's goals with those of its human operators or users. These datasets help LLM's stay consistent with human values and preferences.

## üîß Tools

To create a high-quality dataset, focus on carefully curating a diverse set of relevant, accurate, and informative examples rather than simply maximizing dataset size.

Start by aggregating available data from various sources (open-source or not) and applying filters like data deduplication and data quality. If the initial dataset is small or insufficient, consider synthetically generating additional data that mirrors its quality and style. Iteratively explore and refine the dataset by assessing model performance, identifying gaps, and collecting or generating data to address those shortcomings.

Tools listed in this section may belong to several categories but appear in only one for clarity.

### Data deduplication and decontamination
* **Exact deduplication**: Remove identical samples with data normalization (e.g., convert text to lowercase), hash generation (e.g., create an MD5 or SHA-256 hash for each sample), and duplicate removal.
* **Fuzzy deduplication**
  * **MinHash**: Fuzzy deduplication with hashing, sorting, and Jaccard similarity (preferred technique).
  * **BLOOM filters**: Fuzzy deduplication with hashing and fixed-size vector.
* **Decontamination**: Remove samples too close to test sets, using either exact or fuzzy filtering.

### Data quality evaluation
* **Rule-based filtering**: Remove samples based on a list of unwanted words, like refusals and "As an AI assistant" ([example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cognitivecomputations/WizardLM_alpaca_evol_instruct_70k_unfiltered/blob/main/wizardlm_clean.py)).
